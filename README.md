# Challenge made for vidflex company

#### I did this thinking this is just a challenge:
* I didn't do a high percentage of coverage with unit testing, just the handlers layer.
* I could use a framework for the database, but so that don't take much time, I use builtin library of Go with native queries.
* I did some configurations that should be improved for production environments (for example: cors to dont allow all origins)
* This is my first time using docker without any knowledge before, so it can contain some "bad practices" or mistakes.
